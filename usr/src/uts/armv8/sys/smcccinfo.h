/*
 * Secure Monitor Call Calling Convention Information
 *
 * Document Reference: Arm DEN0028 SMC Calling Convention
 *
 * The SMCCC defines a calling convention for making secure monitor calls (SMC)
 * to access firmware services at runtime.  Depending on the system, these
 * secure monitor calls might be substituted with Hypervisor calls (HVC). These
 * trap types are called conduits in SMCCC-lingo.
 *
 * There are both 32bit and 64bit ABIs available for the calls, so we end up
 * with four flavours of call:
 * - 32bit Secure Monitor Call
 * - 32bit Hypervisor Call
 * - 64bit Secure Monitor Call
 * - 64bit Hypervisor Call
 *
 * 32bit calls accept eight parameters, the first of which is the function
 * identifier and the remaining are arguments.
 *
 * 64bit calls accept 18 parameters, the first of which is the function
 * identifier and the remaining are arguments.
 *
 * Return values are placed into the same registers as calls, with the
 * convention that the return code is in the first parameter and any additional
 * data is either colocated with the return code or is placed into additional
 * parameters.
 *
 * SMCCC itself appears to be an abstraction of the mechanism derived to carry
 * the PSCI API (DEN0022).  As such, one infers the presence of SMCCC by the
 * presence of PSCI.  Due to this historical accident, the SMCCC Information
 * interface also provides information about the PSCI implementation.
 *
 * SMCCC, as defined by DEN0028, defines a number of architectural functions
 * that can be used to learn about the SoC and implement workarounds for
 * hardware sidechannel bugs.
 *
 * There are a number of other useful firmware interfaces built on top of
 * SMCCC. Of particular interest is:
 *   DEN0115: ArmÂ® PCI Configuration Space Access Firmware Interface
 * This specification provides a firmware interface to paper over the quirks
 * in half-baked SoCs so that operating systems reduce the number of quirks
 * they need to deal with when bringing up PCI/PCIe devices.
 *
 * The functions defined by the SMCCC Information interface exist to abstract
 * detection of the presence of SMCCC.  Individual API interfaces detect
 * the presence of their specific implementations using the call interface
 * defined by the SMCCC interface.
 *
 * This chicken-and-egg approach to identifying what functionality we can call
 * is a little infuriating.  It is entirely possibe that we end up with PSCI
 * but without general SMCCC functionality, in which case the SMCCC interface
 * moves into a PSCI-only mode.
