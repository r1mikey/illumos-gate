= DDI Interrupt Framework

== Introduction

This is an attempt to explain the DDI interrupt framework as it
currently exists, attempt to explain how we got here, and to document
the choices made for the AArch64 port (which are not set in stone, this
is a living document).

Some or all of this content should be transplanted to act as big theory
comments in the relevant sources, or parts of the manual, but as things are
still up in the air it is better to have a single – consistent – document, and
to piece it out to match the implementation when that has become firmer. We
hope.

NOTE: illumos support for the SPARC platform is obsolete, but its DDI interrupt
implementation is described here because it is so different from that on
Intel, and potentially so similar to that on AArch64.

NOTE: When surveying drivers implementations we have intentionally stuck with
busses in active use (at least up until the hardware itself was not).  That
is, the PCMCIA, Cardbus, SBus, etc. implementations were not inspected.

== Terminology

Interrupt:: The general concept of a device alerting the CPU that it needs service.

Vector::
  The identifying aspect of an interrupt at the current layer of the
  device tree.  The first interrupt on device A maybe has vector 8 on the bridge A
  it is connected to, and vector 73 at the interrupt controller.  The system
  assumes at times that this is representable as a single 32bit value.

Interrupt Domain::
  The subgraphs of the device tree with a shared interrupt representation.
  Transitioning between interrupt domains will usually require that the vector
  be translated into a value in the new domain.

Interrupt Controller::
  A device which receives interrupts from a subordinate device, and generates
  interrupts on a superior device.  There maybe a single interrupt controller
  fielding all interrupts in a system and passing them to CPU cores, there may
  be a hierarchy of them.

Interrupt Hierarchy::
  A path from a peripheral device to the root interrupt controller, passing
  through each device that needs to be involved in programming the interrupt.

Nexus::
  A non-leaf illumos device driver, performing bus operations on behalf
  of its children.

Root Nexus::
  The nexus driver at the root of the device tree, the `rootnex` driver.  The
  tree node is conventionally named for the hardware platform. **i86pc**,
  **Oxide,Gimlet**, **SUNW,Sun-Fire-T200**, **RaspberryPi,4** etc.  Note that
  the root nexus is only the root of the device tree _it may not be the root
  of the interrupt hierarchy_.

Device Tree::
  The illumos abstraction over the hardware that exists in a
  system and its topology.  A tree of `dev_info_t`.  Note that throughout this
  document we refer to "the device tree" in this context, separate from the
  <<devicetree-org, Devicetree>> specification , which it superficially
  resembles due to their shared ancestry in <<1275-ofw, 1275 OpenFirmware>>.

== State of the World and its History

There are two interrupt frameworks in the DDI, one of them obsolete and based
on <<struct-intrspec, `struct intrspec`>> which survives, at all levels of the
framework, on one platform, though it is fairly clear that is leftover
code from prior the first framework being obsolete, which became convenient
mechanism on top of which implement the second framework.

It is probable, based on the PSARC history reflected in <<References>> that
what we simplify here as "the first obsolete DDI framework" is in fact several
evolutions that were at the time thought distinct.  There are also
evolutionary predecessors of DDI2 that were added to DDI1 and then obsoleted
by the introduction of DDI2.  These are not described.

NOTE: A lot of this history is reconstructed from what evidence remains.
We've done our best.

In the beginning there is Motorola 68000, and following that there is SPARC.
Up until the late 90's interrupt hardware on these platforms was fully in
Sun's control and it, by design, followed the device tree without a separate
interrupt hierarchy.  In the late 90's Sun wanted to use off-the-shelf
hardware for stuff like USB, and with that came interrupt hardware that does
not follow the device tree.  Sun used the OpenFirmware additions originally
from IBM/Apple/Motorola for PowerPC hardware to support this.  In the early
2000's MSI/X become critical, and DDI2 is implemented.  By this time, Intel is
a first-class platform.

Along side these platforms appears Intel, in the early 1990s. It presents a
number of problems.

. The interrupt hierarchy is nothing like the device hierarchy
. There are a variety of low-level hardware implementations of multi-processor
  support, which does not officially yet exist from Intel.  These necessarily
  include different interrupt implementations, CPU interfaces, etc. 

[sidebar]
.The _Kernel Binary Interface_ (KBI)
--
At this time (the early 90's) it became apparent that shipping a `unix` binary
per platform was unwieldy (on SPARC), especially for providing binary software
patches.  On the Intel platform it is even more unweildy because as mentioned
before, multi-processor support at this time was machine specific at deeply
low levels.  Each such machine would require its own `unix` like SPARC, but
that makes it nearly impossible for 3rd parties to support their own machine.

The solution was several projects under the umbrella of a Kernel Binary
Interface project, which attempted to restructure the kernel to solve these
(and other) problems.  It did a lot, but was never fully completed.
--

The implementation for Intel added the concept of a _Platform Support Module_
(PSM) which appears among what appear to be a burst of PSARC cases relating to
x86 coming to life.  Filesystem support, the x86 DDI, the booting system, and
the filesystem all appear in a single block of cases here.  Nothing survives
to tell us why they thought the DDI1 interrupt interfaces were a bad match for
these systems but we can guess -- the same reasons it was a bad match for
late-90's and early-2000's SPARC.  "Weird" interrupt hierarchies, cascaded
controllers, etc., with the additional problem in the larger platform of the
entirely different multi-processor implementations.  The PSM is added as a
temporary solution until KBI solves the problem.  KBI didn't solve the
problem.  The PSM interface goes from temporary to carefully versioned
architecture over the next handful of years.

Now, perhaps as something of a surprise is PowerPC.  Sun briefly added support
for PReP-based PowerPC systems, and by chance some of <<psarc-ppc, this case>>
is available to us.  They describe wanting to use the PSM-style interfaces for
simplicity, because the "real" KBI is far away, and because of the hardware
similarity (this is presumed to be, again, the "weird" interrupt hierarchy and
cascading, only this time with OpenPIC.  I can't think of what other
similarity there could possibly be).  They were also waiting -- with the
benefit of hindsight -- for CHRP, in which 1275 OpenFirmware was finally
implemented.  PowerPC support didn't last long enough to see any future
relevant interrupt changes.

== Interrupts as they exist

Interrupts are generated by devices and sent ultimately to a core to be
serviced.

_Fixed interrupts_ are traditional interrupts that were originally wired to
interrupt pins on the CPU core, but are now wired to one (or more) interrupt
controllers (which may be part of the CPU), and may at the hardware level in
fact be entirely emulated (such as with PCIe INTx interrupts, which emulate
the PCI INTA#-INTD# pins via messages at the PCIe level but appear as
traditional fixed interrupts outside of the PCIe domain, or UltraSPARC Mondos
which are effectively message signalled, and may carry data).

Fixed interrupts may require per-device handling at any stage between the device
generating the interrupt and the CPU core handling it.  This may include
translating the interrupt vector into the domain of the parent device,
programming an intervening interrupt controller (as may be the case with
GPIO), or simple bookkeeping tasks.

Fixed interrupts may be shared between devices, and in a typical PCI or PCIe
system could be shared extensively.  x86 systems in particular have a greatly
limited number of fixed interrupt signals available at the CPU.

_Message Signalled Interrupts_ were optionally added by PCI specification, and
made mandatory by PCI Express.  A controller exists in the system (perhaps
part of the PCIe host bridge) which provides one or more memory-mapped
mailboxes.  A write to a given mailbox with a given value generates an
interrupt on the CPU perhaps translating that MSI into the native platform
interrupt format (as often on AArch64 and SPARC), or posting the interrupt
directly and transparently (Intel).

MSI are by definition not shared, and the mailbox/value uniquely identify a
given interrupt of a given device.

PCI functions may have up to 32 MSI, though the system may allocate fewer for
them and software must be capable of receiving fewer interrupts than
requested.  An extension, MSI-X, allows each function to have up to 2048
interrupts.  MSI-X _may_ be shared, after a fashion, using the same
mailbox/value pair, to handle the case where the system provides fewer
interrupts than were requested.

The allocation and management of MSI is at the limit, the purpose of the
<<resource-manager>>.  Fixed interrupts have no (hardware resource) allocation
phase.

=== The First Framework (henceforth DDI1)

`struct bus_ops` entry points <<bus-get-intrspec, `.bus_get_intrspec`>>,
<<bus-add-intrspec, `.bus_add_intrspec`>>, <<bus-remove-intrspec,
`.bus_remove_intrspec`>> and <<bus-intr-ctl, `.bus_intr_ctl`>>

These are never used, and are `NULL` throughout the current
implementation. The `xxx_get_intrspec` functions in some nexuses used for
bookkeeping were initially the implementation of `.bus_get_intrspec` and
survived into the implementation of the second framework.

This is the working theory as to why the relationships between
<<struct-intrspec, `intrspec`>> and <<interrupt-handle,
`ddi_intr_handle_impl_t`>> are so hazy (see the descriptions of DDI1 and DDI2
compatibility, in the <<platform-implementations>> section).

The client API from this framework is preserved:
**ddi_get_iblock_cookie(9F)**, **ddi_add_intr(9F)**, **ddi_remove_intr(9F)**
**ddi_dev_nintrs(9F)**, **ddi_get_soft_iblock_cookie(9F)**, **ddi_add_softintr(9F)**
**ddi_remove_softintr(9F)**, **ddi_trigger_softintr(9F)**, **ddi_idevice_cookie(9S)**
**ddi_iblock_cookie(9S)**, **ddi_intr_hilevel(9F)**, and is called out here to
make clear these are obsolete entry points, not sources of inspiration.

[#struct-intrspec]
==== `struct intrspec`

An interrupt specifier, an opaque `ddi_intrspec_t` is used for what public and
semi-public interfaces still exist.

There are also bus-specific `intrspec` structures on SPARC, `sbbc_intrspec`
(serengeti boot bus controller, used on the Fire 15K family).  and
`fhcintrspec` (firehose controller, used on Enterprise xx00).  Neither is
referenced, but there is the suggestion that bus-specific structures could be
used in place of this structure in the framework.

`uint_t intrspec_pri`:: The interrupt priority, equivalent to `ih_pri` in DDI2.
`uint_t intrspec_vec`:: The interrupt vector, equivalent to `ih_vector` in DDI2.
`uint_t (*intrspec_func())`::
  The interrupt handler, if `0` the interrupt is unconfigured, if `1` (**XXX I
  think this is about fasttraps or "fast interrupts" but the comment stops short**)

==== `ddi_iblock_cookie_t`

An _interrupt block cookie_.  This is the virtual interrupt priority as would
used when initializing locks.

==== `ddi_idevice_cookie_t`

Interrupt priority and vector information for a device.  See
**ddi_idevice_cookie(9S)**.  We do not know what the use for this was.

[#bus-get-intrspec]
==== `ddi_intrspec_t .bus_get_intrspec(dev_info_t *dip, dev_into_t *rdip, uint_t inumber)`

Return the interrupt specifier for `rdip`s `inumber`th interrupt.

Constructed by `make_ddi_ppd()` and stored in the _parent private data_ (ppd,
`struct ddi_parent_private_data`) of `rdip`.  This is hypothesized to be the
mechanism by which the bus-specific `intrspec`s come into use.

Bus-specific versions of the parent private data may exist, such as that
created by `pci_common_set_parent_private_data()`.  Bus-specific accessors of
this information may exist such as `pci_intx_get_ispec()`.

[#bus-add-intrspec]
==== `int (*bus_add_intrspec)(dev_info_t *dip, dev_info_t *rdip, ddi_intrspec_t intrspec, ddi_iblock_cookie_t *ibcp, ddi_idevice_cookie_t *idcp, uint_t (*int_handler)(caddr_t intr_handler_arg), caddr_t intr_handler_arg, int kind)`

Set `int_handler` to handle the interrupt `intrspec` and enable it.  This was
the implementation of **ddi_add_intr(9F)**

[#bus-remove-intrspec]
==== `void (*bus_remove_intrspec)(dev_info_t *dip, dev_info_t *rdip, ddi_intrspec_t intrspec, ddi_iblock_cookie_t iblock_cookie)`

Cease handling the interrupt of `rdip` represented by `intrspec`.  This was the
implementation of **ddi_remove_intr(9F)**.

[#bus-intr-ctl]
==== `int (*bus_intr_ctl)(dev_info_t *dip, dev_info_t *rdip, ddi_intr_ctlop_t ctlop, void *arg, void *result)`

This was part of an initial operation-based interface, dispatched on
`ddi_intr_ctlop_t ctlop`.  Unfortunately, the removal of this interface also
removed the names of these operations.  It is hypothesized that these provided
the initial mechanism to support "unnatural" interrupts on SPARC.  That is,
interrupts that deviate from the device tree hierarchy.

NOTE: It is very likely that the bugs related to **"#interrupt-cells"** were
either introduced here, or this code handled this correctly and then DDI2 once
again made the vector a single `uint32_t`.

=== The Second Framework (henceforth DDI2)

Appeared in the <<psarc-ddi2, early 2000's as part of adding support for
Message Signalled Interrupts (MSI/MSI-X)>>.  Adding both the notion of
different <<interrupt-types, types>> of interrupt, and facilities for the
increased management needs (capability, resource, priority management).  The
resource management facilities were -- we think -- overtaken by the
<<resource-manager, Interrupt Resource Manager>>.

- Client drivers have an <<interrupt-handle, _interrupt handle_>>
`ddi_intr_handle_t` which is entirely opaque (the framework has the concrete
`ddi_intr_handle_impl_t`), and make requests based on this handle.

- Nexus drivers implement the <<bus-intr-op, `.bus_intr_op()`>> entry point,
which dispatches based on its <<interrupt-operations, `ddi_intr_op_t
intr_op`>> argument.

A client driver makes requests via indirectly `i_ddi_intr_ops()` with its own
dip as both `pdip` and `rdip`.  These requests recurse up the device tree
allowing the system to program intervening devices or coordinate on the
availability of resources.  The precise manner of this is system specific and
described <<platform-implementations, elsewhere>>.

Client drivers were not converted to the DDI2 interfaces (and many remain
unconverted 20 years later).  Nexus drivers were.

[#bus-intr-op]
==== `.bus_intr_op(dev_info_t *dip, dev_info_t *rdip, ddi_intr_op_t intr_op, ddi_intr_handle_impl_t *hdlp, void *result)`

`dev_info_t *dip`::
  Usually called `pdip` in implementations, the dip of us, the bus.
  Logically `pdip` a parent (actually ancestor) dip of the child,
  unfortunately this is not truly an ancestor in the device tree, but only the
  interrupt hierarchy.

`dev_info_t *rdip`::
  The dip of the leaf device, the one that ultimately generates the
  interrupts we are managing.  It's been suggested at times that the `r`
  indicates "responsible", "requesting", or "resource".  It is possible for
  `dip` and `rdip` to be the same, in cases of bridges with their own
  interrupts.  There is not necessary a familial relationship between `dip` and
  `rdip` in the device tree, only the interrupt tree.  Parent data associated
  with `rdip` cannot be assumed to be in any specific format, and properties
  must be interpreted in the correct domain.

`ddi_intr_op_t intr_op`::
  See <<interrupt-operations>>

`ddi_intr_handle_impl_t *hdlp`::
  The interrupt handle provided by the driver. See the description of <<interrupt-handle, interrupt handles>>.
  This may have been previously allocated via <<ddi-introp-alloc,
  `DDI_INTROP_ALLOC`>> but may not, depending on the operation.  There may be
  inconsistencies between the way a nexus would initialize a handle of its
  own, and the handle that way reach it from child nexuses.  These are bugs.

`void *result`::
  An arbitrary extra return value, of arbitrary meaning to the
  operations. Sometimes used internally to pass information across levels of
  the interrupt hierarchy.  We attempt to describe its use per-operation.

[#interrupt-operations]
==== Interrupt Operations (`ddi_intr_op_t`)

This describes, as best as can be determined, the meaning of the DDI2
interrupt operations. In places where there actual implementation is
known to contradict this meaning – or at least appear to – we note it
here as well.

[#ddi-introp-supported-types]
===== `DDI_INTROP_SUPPORTED_TYPES`

- type of `result`: `int *`
- initial state of `result`: undefined NOTE: aarch64 potentially proposes to
  define it
- final state of `result`: a bitmask of <<interrupt-types, interrupt types>>

This is the implementation of **ddi_intr_get_supported_types(9F)**, the value
of `result` if `DDI_SUCCESS` is returned.  Otherwise the framework invokes
this itself prior to <<ddi-introp-nintrs, `DDI_INTROP_NINTRS`>>,
<<ddi-introp-navail, `DDI_INTROP_NAVAIL`>>, <<ddi-introp-alloc,
`DDI_INTROP_ALLOC`>> to check whether the type requested is supported.

WARNING: Via the implementation of `i_ddi_intr_get_supported_types()`, which
appears to be used as some sort of shortcut, this may be called with a
fictitious `hdlp` which has not been fully initialized, and contains no
`ih_private`.

The return value of this is -- implicitly -- expected to be constant for the
lifetime of `rdip`.

[#ddi-introp-nintrs]
===== `DDI_INTROP_NINTRS`
- type of `result`: `int *`
- initial content of `result`: undefined
- final content of `result`: the total number of interrupts supported by `rdip`

This is the implementation of **ddi_intr_get_nintrs(9F)** and returns the number
of interrupts of the given type supported by a given device.

`ih_type` is guaranteed to be supported by `rdip` as claimed by <<ddi-introp-supported-types, `DDI_INTROP_SUPPORTED_TYPES`>>

The return value of this is -- implicitly -- expected to be constant for the
lifetime of `rdip`.

NOTE: it is incorrect -- but not asserted -- to return `DDI_SUCCESS` but store
`0` in `result`.

WARNING: this is different from <<ddi-introp-navail, `DDI_INTROP_NAVAIL`>>
although only for MSI/X.  Even then we can't find an implementation that acts
differently. 

[#ddi-introp-alloc]
===== `DDI_INTROP_ALLOC`
- type of `result`: `int *`
- initial content of `result`: undefined
- final content of `result`: the number of interrupts actually allocated
  (v. that requested)

Allocate an interrupt handle `hdlp`, based on `ih_inum` and `rdip`. The
specifics of what this entails are interrupt type specific. MSI and MSIX
vectors may actually be allocated and assigned here by programming the
interrupt controller (PCI on Intel).

`ih_scratch1` is the offset into the requested range of interrupts.
`ih_scratch2` is used for the flags described by **ddi_intr_alloc(9F)**

The framework guarantees that `ih_type` is valid per
<<ddi-introp-supported-types, `DDI_INTROP_SUPPORTED_TYPES`>> and that
`ih_inum` + `ih_scratch1` is valid per <<ddi-introp-nintrs,
`DDI_INTROP_NINTRS`>>.

WARNING: The `hdlp` used here is temporary with only the `ih_type`, `ih_inum`
and `ih_dip`, `ih_scratch1` and `ih_scratch2` fields valid.  The nexus may
modify `hdlp` but it does not survive.

[#ddi-introp-getpri]
===== `DDI_INTROP_GETPRI`
- type of `result`: `uint_t *`
- initial content of `result`: undefined
- final content of `result`: the interrupt priority level

Return the interrupt priority level of the interrupt described by `hdlp`.
`ih_pri` may be invalid -- 0 -- and need to be established by the
implementation, which should also set `ih_pri`.  The framework may or may not
call this while `ih_pri` is already non-0. 

WARNING: `ih_dip`, `ih_type`, `ih_inum` and fields set by <<ddi-introp-alloc,
`DDI_INTROP_ALLOC`>> are valid, others are not (this is used in the
**ddi_intr_alloc(9F)** path, on partially constructed handles).

[#ddi-introp-setpri]
===== `DDI_INTROP_SETPRI`
- type of `result`:  `uint_t *`
- initial content of `result`: the desired priority level
- final content of `result`: the actual priority level set

Set the interrupt priority level of the interrupt associated with `hdlp`.
`hdlp` can be relied upon to be fully initialized.

[#ddi-introp-addisr]
===== `DDI_INTROP_ADDISR`
- type of `result`: void

Add a handler for the interrupt described by `hdlp`. The specifics of what
happens here is implementation specific. It might be as much as programming
the interrupt controller, or as little as nothing at all.  This is the
implementation of **ddi_intr_add_handler(9F)**.  This will not be invoked
again for an interrupt for which it has already succeeded.

[#ddi-introp-dupvec]
===== `DDI_INTROP_DUPVEC`
- type of `result`: void

Duplicate the interrupt handler. This is implemented only by the PCIe nexus on
SPARC. This is the implementation of *ddi_intr_dup_handler(9f)*, which is
only used by the QLogic fibre-channel driver *qlc(4D)*.

`hdlp` can be assumed to be fully valid
`ih_scratch1`: contains the interrupt vector into which to duplicate `hdlp`.

NOTE: Absent a compelling reason to implement this (and the entire feature
behind it), just return `DDI_FAILURE`.

[#ddi-introp-enable]
===== `DDI_INTROP_ENABLE`
- type of `result`: void

Enable the interrupt described by `hdlp`. This is implementation
dependent and might do as little as nothing (the SPARC root nexus), or some
book-keeping (SPARC PCIe), to as much as adding the ISR and
programming the interrupt-controller (the i86 root nexus, i86 PCI).

`hdlp` can be assumed to be valid, and that <<ddi-introp-addisr,
`DDI_INTROP_ADDISR`>> has been succeeded at least once. 

if `ih_cap` includes `DDI_INTR_FLAG_BLOCK` this operation is not used and
<<ddi-introp-blockenable, `DDI_INTROP_BLOCKENABLE`>> is.

The DDI1 **ddi_add_intr(9F)** will reach here.

[#ddi-introp-blockenable]
===== `DDI_INTROP_BLOCKENABLE`::
- type of `result`: void

Enable a block of interrupts, the implementation of
**ddi_intr_block_enable(9F)**.

`hdlp` is the first of the block allocated via the <<ddi-introp-alloc,
`DDI_INTROP_ALLOC`>> path.
`ih_scratch1` is the number of interrupts in the block,
`ih_scratch2` is pointer to the array of handles comprising the block.

This is only used for interrupts with the `DDI_INTR_FLAG_BLOCK`
<<interrupt-capabilities, capability>>, where it is used in place of
<<ddi-introp-enable, `DDI_INTROP_ENABLE`>>.

WARNING: The implementation of this entry point _may itself use_
<<ddi-introp-enable, `DDI_INTROP_ENABLE`>>.

[#ddi-introp-blockdisable]
===== `DDI_INTROP_BLOCKDISABLE`
- type of `result`: `void`

Disable a block of interrupts, the implementation of
**ddi_intr_block_disable(9F)**

`hdlp` is the first of the block from the <<ddi-introp-alloc,
`DDI_INTROP_ALLOC`>> operation, `ih_scratch1` is the number of interrupts in
the block, `ih_scratch2` is a pointer to an array of handles comprising the
block.

Will not be called on interrupts that have not previously been enabled.

Only used for interrupts with the `DDI_INTR_FLAG_BLOCK`
<<interrupt-capabilities, interrupt capability], where it
should be used in place of <<ddi-introp-disable, `DDI_INTROP_DISABLE`>>

WARNING: The implementation of this entry _may itself use_
<<ddi-introp-enable, `DDI_INTROP_ENABLE`>>

[#ddi-introp-disable]
===== `DDI_INTROP_DISABLE`
- type of `result`: `void`

Disable the interrupt described by `hdlp`.  Might update the `ispec` and
de-program the interrupt controller for this interrupt (i86 rootnex, PCI),
mask the interrupt (SPARC PCIe), or do nothing at all (SPARC rootnex).

`hdlp` is fully valid.
Will not be invoked for interrupts that have not previously been enabled.

[#ddi-introp-remisr]
===== `DDI_INTROP_REMISR`
- type of `result`: `void`:

The implementation of **ddi_intr_add_handler(9F)**.  Remove the handler
associated with `hdlp`.  Might do as little as setting the function in the
`intrspec` to NULL not affecting processing at all (i86 rootnex), doing some
additional bookkeeping too (i86 PCI), actually removing and de-programming the
interrupt (SPARC rootnex), and removing and de-programming the interrupt only
_harder_ (SPARC PCIe).

`hdlp` is fully valid.

Will not be invoked unless a previous <<ddi-introp-addisr,
`DDI_INTROP_ADDISR`>> has succeeded, and a previous call to this interface has
_not_ succeeded.

[#ddi-introp-free]
===== `DDI_INTROP_FREE`
- type of `result`: `void`

Deallocate an interrupt handle `hdlp`.  The specifics of this are
implementation-specific.  This may de-program the vector (MSI i86 rootnex on
apix, i86 MSI PCI, i86 FIXED on apix) or do nothing (SPARC rootnex, PCIe).  If
this does nothing, code comments suggest that the actual freeing is done in
<<ddi-introp-disable, `DDI_INTROP_DISABLE`>> or *ddi_intr_disable(9F)*, and
that this is the "old" style.

Will only be invoked for which <<ddi-introp-alloc, `DDI_INTROP_ALLOC`>> has
succeeded, and have either never had an handler attached with
<<ddi-introp-addisr, `DDI_INTROP_ADDISR`>>, or has had the handler removed
by <<ddi-introp-remisr, `DDI_INTROP_REMISR`>>

WARNING: `ih_scratch1` always has the value 1, even for blocks of
interrupts. A bug?

[#ddi-introp-getcap]
===== `DDI_INTROP_GETCAP`
- type of `result`: `int *`
- initial content of `result`: 0
- final content of `result`: A mask of <<interrupt-capabilities, interrupt capabilities>>

Return in `result` the <<interrupt-capabilities, capabilities>> of the
interrupt described by `hdlp`.  the implementation of
**ddi_intr_get_cap(9F)**.  `hdlp` may either be a temporary handle or a real
handle, but will always have had a successful <<ddi-introp-alloc,
`DDI_INTROP_ALLOC`>> and <<ddi-introp-getpri, `DDI_INTROP_GETPRI`>> performed
on it.

The i86pc rootnex and pci ask the system, the SPARC rootnex says all
interrupts are level-triggered, SPARC PCIe asks the system.

WARNING: `ih_cap` is not necessarily valid, and should not be used unless this
implementation has initialized it.

[#ddi-introp-setcap]
===== `DDI_INTROP_SETCAP`
- type of `result`: `int *`
- initial content of `result`: the desired mask of <<interrupt-capabilities, interrupt capabilities>>
- final content of `result`: ignored

Set the capabilities specified, the implementation of
**ddi_intr_set_cap(9F)**.

`hdlp` may either be a temporary handle or a
real handle, but will always have had a successful <<ddi-introp-alloc,
`DDI_INTROP_ALLOC`>> and <<ddi-introp-getpri, `DDI_INTROP_GETPRI`>> performed
on it.

WARNING: The desired capabilities may include any capabilities, included those
indicated to be read-only.

WARNING: This is rarely implemented, and where it is implemented only the
edge/level capability are writable.  The i86 rootnex implements this.

[#ddi-introp-setmask]
===== `DDI_INTROP_SETMASK`
- type of `result`: `void`

Set masking of the interrupt described by `hdlp`.  This is the implementation
of **ddi_intr_set_mask(9F)**.  For MSI/X this updates the mask bits in the
hardware.  For other interrupts either ask the system (i86), or fail (SPARC).

`hdlp` refers to a valid enabled interrupt which has the
`DDI_INTR_FLAG_MASKABLE` <<interrupt-capabilities, capability>>

[#ddi-introp-clrmask]
===== `DDI_INTROP_CLRMASK`
- type of result `void`

Clear masking of the interrupt described by `hdlp`.  This is the
implementation of **ddi_intr_clr_mask(9F)**.  For MSI/X this updates the mask
bits in the hardware.  For other interrupts either ask the system (i86), or
fail (SPARC).

`hdlp` refers to a valid enabled interrupt which has the
`DDI_INTR_FLAG_MASKABLE` <<interrupt-capabilities, capability>>

[#ddi-introp-getpending]
===== `DDI_INTROP_GETPENDING`
- type of `result`: `int *`
- initial content of `result`: undefined
` final content of `result` on defined: non-0 if an interrupt is pending

Determine if an interrupt described by `hdlp` is pending.  For PCI MSI/X
fetches the pending bit from the hardware, for other interrupts is either
not supported or, on i86, asks the system.

WARNING: In practice, nobody consumes this interface.  The states at which it
may be called is unknown

[#ddi-introp-navail]
===== `DDI_INTROP_NAVAIL`
- type of `result`: `uint_t *`
- initial content of `result`: undefined
- final content of `result`: the number of interrupts available for allocation
  for `rdip`

Return in `*result` the number of interrupts _available_ to `rdip`.  This is
the implementation of **ddi_intr_get_navail(9F)**.

`hdlp` may be real of temporary, only the `ih_type` and `ih_dip` can be
relied on.

WARNING: this is different from <<ddi-introp-navail, `DDI_INTROP_NINTRS`> in
the MSI/X case, although we can't find an implementation that acts
differently.

- type of `result`: `ddi_irm_pool_t **`
- initial content of `result`: undefined
- final content of `result`: a pointer to the <<irm-pool, IRM pool>>
  governing this interrupt

Return the resource management pool associated with (the `ih_dip` of) `hdlp`.
This is part of the Interrupt Resource Management interfaces used
exclusively by the x86 and SPARC PCI drivers.  Return `NULL` and
`DDI_ENOTSUP` if no such mapping exists.  This is the implementation of
`i_ddi_intr_get_pool()`.

`hdlp` may be real of temporary, only `ih_dip` and `ih_type` can be relied
upon.

[#ddi-introp-gettarget]

- final content of `result`: the CPU to which this interrupt is directed

Get the target CPU of the interrupt described by `hdlp`.  These are the
interrupt affinity interfaces, and are only implemented on busses for which
this is worthwhile (PCI and the bus on which sun4v native network interfaces
live).

`hdlp` can be fully trusted, but see below.

WARNING: This is the implementation of `get_intr_affinity()` but nobody uses that

[#interrupt-types]
==== Interrupt Types

`DDI_INTR_TYPE_FIXED`:: Traditional interrupts (including PCIe INTx)
`DDI_INTR_TYPE_MSI`:: Message Signalled Interrupts
`DDI_INTR_TYPE_MSIX`:: Extended Message Signalled Interrupts

These have values such that they may be used in a bitmask to indicate which
types a device supports (`DDI_INTROP_SUPPORTED_TYPES`).

[#interrupt-handle]
==== Interrupt Handle (`ddi_intr_handle_impl_t`)

Client drivers refer to interrupts (or blocks of them) via an opaque
`ddi_intr_handle_t` which is actually a `ddi_intr_handle_impl_t` in the
implementation.

`dev_info_t *ih_dip`::
  dip of the device associated with this handle.  The `rdip` of the interrupt
  operation (it is assumed, but never asserted).

`uint16_t ih_type`::
  The <<interrupt-types, interrupt type>>.
  NOTE: because these are arranged so as to be usable as a bitmask, the maximum type number is 16 here not `USHORT_MAX`.

`ushort_t ih_inum`::
  The _interrupt number_.  This is the `inum` in the old interfaces.  For
  fixed interrupts this is a 0-based index into the interrupts supported by
  `ih_dip` (in device tree terms, this is the index into the *"interrupts"*
  property).  For MSI this is the "relative interrupt number", across the
  whole range of MSI supported by the device.

`uint32_t ih_vector`::
  The interrupt vector.  This is initially derived from `ih_inum` but updated as
  interrupt requests move through the device tree to ultimately contain the
  vector from the point of view of the main interrupt controller.  On SPARC
  and AArch64 this is re-set between requests, so that interrupts maybe
  re-mapped.  Intel need not do this because the PSM sets <<interrupt-flags,
  flags>> indicating the domain of `ih_vector`.

`uint16_t ih_ver`::
  Interrupt handle version.  `DDI_INTR_VERSION`.  NOTE: this is the 5th
  element in the structure.  Its offset must be maintained for the version
  checking it allows for to remain possible.  This is also used by the
  <<psm-intr-op-apic-type, `PSM_INTR_OP_APIC_TYPE`>> operation in Intel PSMs
  to return the APIC version.

`uint_t ih_state`::
  The <<interrupt-state, interrupt state>>

`uint_t ih_cap`::
  The <<interrupt-capabilities, interrupt capabilities>> of this interrupt.  Initialized on
  interrupt allocation, and also during **ddi_intr_get_cap(9F)*.  These seem
  to be the maximal capabilities of this interrupt on this device, and not
  those potentially affected by **ddi_intr_set_cap(9F)**.

`uint_t ih_pri`::
  The interrupt virtual priority.  This has a bus-dependent meaning, and like
  `ih_vector` maybe be updated during interrupt processing.  Unlike
  `ih_vector` it is not re-set between requests.  This is described as being
  in the range `DDI_INTR_PRI_MIN` and `DDI_INTR_PRI_MAX` for "most drivers".
  May be used directly for lock initialization.

`krwlock_t ih_rwlock`::
  reader/writer lock protecting the members of this handle.

`uint_t (*ih_cb_func)(caddr_t, caddr_t)`::
  The interrupt handler.

`void *ih_cb_arg1`::
  The first argument to be passed to the interrupt handler.

`void *ih_cb_arg2`::
  The second argument to be passed to the interrupt handler.

`uint_t ih_flags`::
  Flags used in MSIX support, see the descriptions of <<interrupt-flags, interrupt flags>>

`uint_t ih_dup_cnt`::
  The number of duplicated MSI-X vectors.  Used to prevent vectors which have
  been duplicated from having their handler removed.  It is not clear what
  this is allowing for which <<ddi-intr-msix-dup, `DDI_INTR_MSIX_DUP`>> is
  not, since all current checks are of non-0.

`struct ddi_intr_handle_impl *ih_main`::
  The handle from which this handle was duplicated.

`void *ih_private`::
  Private platform-specific data.  Allegedly but not actually unused on SPARC.
  This is usually an `ihdl_plat_t` (<<intel-ihdl-plat, intel>>, <<aarch64-ihdl-plat,
  aarch64>>), but is also used for other purposes on some platforms.
  See the <<psm-intr-op-set-cpu, `PSM_INTR_OP_SET_CPU`>>,
  <<psm-intr-op-get-intr, `PSM_INTR_OP_GET_INTR`>>,
  <<psm-intr-op-grp-set-cpu, `PSM_INTR_OP_GRP_SET_CPU`>> and
  <<psm-intr-op-apic-type, `PSM_INTR_OP_APIC_TYPE`>> <<psm-operations, PSM
  operations>> on Intel.  SPARC only uses this field for soft interrupts.

`uint_t ih_scratch1`::
  Used to hold the number of interrupts in the interrupt array for
  <<ddi-introp-blockenable, `DDI_INTROP_BLOCKENABLE`>>/`DDI_INTROP_BLOCKDISABLE`.  Used to hold the number
  of interrupts actually allocated for <<ddi-introp-alloc, `DDI_INTROP_ALLOC`>> to return in `*return`.

`void *ih_scratch2`::
  The array of interrupt handles for
  <<ddi-introp-blockenable, `DDI_INTROP_BLOCKENABLE`>>/`DDI_INTROP_BLOCKDISABLE`, or the flags passed when
  allocating MSI vectors.  "behaviour" information is stored here when for
  <<ddi-introp-alloc, `DDI_INTROP_ALLOC`>> in the PCI implementation on Intel.

`processorid_t ih_target`::
  The processor the interrupt targets.  Only set or updated during
  **ddi_intr_add_handler(9F)** and by `set_intr_affinity()`.

[#interrupt-state]
==== Interrupt State

`DDI_IHDL_STATE_ALLOC`:: Handle allocated, **ddi_intr_alloc(9F)** called.
`DDI_IHDL_STATE_ADDED`:: Interrupt handler added, **ddi_intr_add_handler(9F)** called.
`DDI_IHDL_STATE_ENABLE`:: Enabled. **ddi_intr_enable(9F)** called.

image::ihdl-state.svg[]

WARNING: There is no path from the allocated to the unallocated state, maybe that's a bug.

[#interrupt-flags]
==== Interrupt Flags

NOTE: These are values used with the `ih_flags` member of <<interrupt-handle,
the interrupt handle>>, not those named `DDI_INTR_FLAG_` which are
<<interrupt-capabilities, interrupt capabilities>>

[#ddi-intr-msix-dup]
`DDI_INTR_MSIX_DUP`::
   This `hdlp` is one from **ddi_intr_dup_handler(9F)**.  This allows
   duplicate handles to be treated specially in the framework to preserve them
   as duplicates, and the system to assert their properties match those of
   their `ih_main`.

[#psmgi-intrby-vec]
`PSMGI_INTRBY_VEC`::
   Used by PSMs on Intel platforms.  `ih_vector` contains a vector, and
   interrupt processing should translate it to an IRQ as necessary.

[#psmgi-intrby-irq]
`PSMGI_INTRBY_IRQ`::
   Used by PSMs on Intel platforms.  `ih_vector` contains an IRQ and
   translation is not necessary.

[#psmgi-intrby-default]
`PSMGI_INTRBY_DEFAULT`::
   Used by PSMs on Intel platforms.  `ih_vector` contains a PSM-specific
   default kind of value, and PSMs should do with it what is necessary.

[#interrupt-capabilities]
==== Interrupt Capabilities

`DDI_INTR_FLAG_LEVEL`:: Device/Host support level trigger (usable with **ddi_intr_set_cap(9F)**
`DDI_INTR_FLAG_EDGE`:: Device/Host support Edge trigger (usable with **ddi_intr_set_cap(9F)**
`DDI_INTR_FLAG_MASKABLE`:: May be masked at (or near) the source
`DDI_INTR_FLAG_PENDING`:: Supports checking for pending interrupts
`DDI_INTR_FLAG_BLOCK`:: Requires block enable, interrupts not individually maskable.
`DDI_INTR_FLAG_MSI64`:: Supports 64bit MSI mailboxes.

==== Compatibility with DDI1

The <<struct-intrspec, `struct intrspec`>> array in the parent private data is still created, and
nexus drivers attempt to keep them up to date, although the manner and
direction in which this happens is haphazard in practice.

The only uses of this information I have found so far are either internal to
the nexuses (as part of attempting to maintain this compatibility), or
**prtconf(8)** which knows how to print this information for various busses
(further reinforcing the theory that bus-specific <<struct-intrspec, `struct
intrspec`>> took part in the framework).  It is not clear if there's value in
the information here, it appears to exist for a minority of busses, and like
all DDI1 interfaces only covers fixed interrupts.

The general access for this information are `sparc_pd_getintr()` and
`sparc_pd_getnintr()`.  These are only used by device reporting on Intel and
AArch64.

Access via the private pointers is actually more common. The majority of uses
are nexuses maintaining this information, and perhaps later handing it out
(the `pci_intx_get_ispec()` does this, for example).

<<struct-intrspec, `struct intrspec`>> itself is used in the implementation of
nexuses across 2 of 3 platforms, and all 3 Intel PSMs.  To the extent the
inability to fully represent an interrupt is a problem, further solutions must
be found in common code.

[#resource-manager]
==== Interrupt Resource Manager

The <<psarc-irm, _Interrupt Resource Manager_ (IRM)>> provides a framework
whereby drivers have a variable number of interrupts available to them over
time, according to overall resource demand.  Interrupts are allocated in a
balanced manner, and rebalanced as devices come and go in the system.

Drivers request an initial number of interrupts via **ddi_intr_alloc(9F)**.

Instances of device drivers which do not take part in resource management
receive a fixed and immutable number of interrupts over their lifetime.  They
still receive a limited number of vectors, although this number is now managed
per-nexus and tuned by the IRM, and so a more appropriate number than
previously (where it was 2).

Drivers which take part in resource management register callback functions
using **ddi_cb_register(9F)** which allow them to respond to interrupts being
made available or unavailable, and may request a different number of
interrupts via **ddi_intr_set_nreq(9F)**.

Each supply of interrupts is described via a <<irm-pool, `ddi_irm_pool_t`>>,
which is shared by multiple devices.  These are managed by the MSI controllers
(the interrupt controller hardware in general, on Intel.  The PCIe roots on
SPARC).

For each device driver that interacts with the IRM, a <<irm-request,
`ddi_irm_req_t`>> is maintained by the framework to track the number of
vectors it has requested, and received.

When interrupts operations are performed on a device, nexus drivers maybe be
asked to map device instances to interrupt pools.  This is the
`DDI_INTROP_GETPOOL` operation.

[#irm-pool]
===== IRM Pool (`ddi_irm_pool_t`)

WARNING: The pools are suprisingly not of fixed size.  The APIX PSM on intel
resizes its pool during normal interrupt operations.

[#irm-pool-flags]
===== IRM Pool Flags

A set of flags, arranged such as to be usable in  a bitmask.
NOTE: These flags though in one namespace, cover both <<irm-pool, pool>> and
<<irm-request, request>> flags.

`DDI_IRM_FLAG_ACTIVE`:: Pool is active (pool flag)
`DDI_IRM_FLAG_QUEUED`:: Pool is queued for (re-)balancing (pool flag)

`DDI_IRM_POLICY_EVEN`:: Interrupts are balanced based on `ipool_defsz`

[#irm-params]
===== IRM Pool Paramaters

Parameters used when creating an IRM pool.

`int iparams_types`::
  <<interrupt-types,Types>> of interrupts that will be in this pool.  Note
  that there may be multiple to the extent that makes sense (such as both MSI
  and MSIX).

`int iparams_total`::
  The total number of interrupts in this pool

WARNING: the <<psarc-irm, PSARC case>> mentions an additional field specifying
the default allocation limit.  This is not in the code.

WARNING: this structure may expand, and consumers are advised to fully 0 it. That doesn't actually solve the ABI problem though.

[#ndi-irm-create]
===== `ndi_irm_create(dev_info_t *dip, ddi_irm_params_t *paramsp, ddi_irm_pool_t **pool_retp)`

Create an IRM pool for `dip` with the <<irm-params, parameters>> `*paramsp`,
and return it in `**pool_retp`.  This is the interface by which nexus drivers
or interrupt controller drivers create an IRM pool to manage their interrupts.
Returns `NDI_SUCCESS` on success, or `NDI_FAILURE` if invalid operations are
specified.

===== `ndi_irm_destroy(ddi_irm_pool_t *pool)`

Destroy the IRM pool `pool`.  May not be called until the pool is fully unused
(no device is consuming interrupts in this pool).  Returns `NDI_SUCCESS` on
success, `NDI_FAILURE` if `pool` is invalid, or `NDI_BUSY` if the interrupt
pool is still in use.

[#platform-implementations]
== Platform Implementations

=== Intel

Each interrupt domain speaks directly to the primary interrupt controller via
a _Platform Support Module_ (PSM).  These exist per-style of interrupt
controller:

uppc:: The original uni-processor PC with an 8259 PIC
pcplusmp:: The _Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller_ (APIC)
apix:: The X2 APIC

The PSM provides a global operation vector `struct psm_ops *psmops` which each
nexus driver representing an interrupt domain uses to program the interrupt
controller.  Some (but not all) functions are also exposed via global symbols
of their own.

The control flow is that we move from the device to its interrupt domain and
the <<bus-intr-op, `.bus_intr_op`>> in the nexus driver uses the PSM
interfaces to establish interrupts.  There is no movement between interrupt
domains (unless `pseudo_isa` is true, which it is not by default, in which
case **isa(4D)** will defer to the root nexus).

image:psm-intrs.svg[]

NOTE: Control never moves between child interrupt domains and the root nexus,
except in the nondefault `pseudo_isa == 0` case.

[#psm-ops-vector]
==== PSM operation vector

NOTE: The PSM provides support for other platform-specific operations.  Only
those potentially relevant to interrupts are described here.

`int (*psm_probe)(void)`::
  Called by `psm_install()` during boot to determine which PSM should be used,
  analogous to **identify(9E)**.

`void (*psm_softinit)(void)`::
   Perform self-initialization of the PSM module, analogous to (half of) **attach(9E)**.

`void (*psm_picinit)(void)`::
   Perform initialization of the interrupt controller hardware, analogous to
   (the other half of) **attach(9E)**

`int (*psm_intr_enter)(int ipl, int *vectorp)`::
  Begin handling an interrupt, prior to calling the interrupt handler.  Called
  as `setlvl()` rather than via the vector.  Masks interrupts at or below
  priority level `ipl`, and perform other tasks preparatory
  to handling the interrupt described by `vectorp`.  Return the previous
  interrupt priority level.

`void (*psm_intr_exit)(int ipl, int irqno)`::
  End interrupt handling, after calling the interrupt handler.  Called as
  `setlvlx()` rather than via the vector.  Mask interrupts
  at or below `ipl` (expected to be the level returned from `.psm_intr_enter`)
  and perform other tasks necessary after finishing handling interrupts.

`void (*psm_setspl)(int ipl)`::
  Mask all interrupts at or below `ipl`

`int (*psm_addspl)(int irqno, int ipl, int min_ipl, int max_ipl)`::
  Configure interrupt hardware for `irqno` (actually a vector), masked at or
  above `ipl`, unmasked below `ipl`.  This must handle shared vectors.
  `min_ipl` is used only by the uppc PSM which asserts it is equal to `irqno`.
  `max_ipl` seems entirely unused and its meaning is unclear.  Returns
  `PSM_FAILURE` on error, `PSM_SUCCESS` otherwise

`int (*psm_delspl)(int irqno, int ipl, int min_ipl, int max_ipl)`::
  Deconfigure interrupt handware for `irqno` (actually a vector), disable it and
  reset the priority.  Must account for interrupt sharing.  The `min_ipl` and
  `max_ipl` parameters are used by the uppc PSM.  I'm having trouble
  determining the effect they have there.  It is perhaps related to handling
  sharing.

`int (*psm_disable_intr)(processorid_t cpun)`::
  **OPTIONAL** Try to evacuate all interrupts from core `cpun`, and make it
  unavailable for interrupt processing.  Assign vectors to other cores, unless
  called for Suspend/Resume.  This is the implementation of
  `cpu_intr_disable()` and `cpu_disable_intr()`, one of which seems specific
  to **cpr(4)** Suspend/Resume, the other to Dynamic Reconfiguration.

`void (*psm_enable_intr)(processorid_t cpun)`::
  **OPTIONAL** Allow the core `cpun` to once again take part in interrupt
  processing

`int (*psm_softlvl_to_irq)(int ipl)`::
  **OPTIONAL** Never implemented or called.  Obsolete?

`void (*psm_set_softintr)(int ipl)`::
  **OPTIONAL** Never implemented or called.  Obsolete?

`void (*psm_set_idlecpu)(processorid_t cpun)`::
  **OPTIONAL**  Implementation of `set_idle_cpu()`, called when the core
  `cpun` enters the idle loop.  I haven't found functional implementations of this.

`void (*psm_unset_idlecpu)(processorid_t cpun)`::
  **OPTIONAL** Implementation of `unset_idle_cpu()`, called when the core
  `cpun` leaves the idle loop.  I haven't found functional implementations of this.

`void (*psm_clkinit)(int hertz)`::
  Configure the clock interrupt to fire at `hertz`.  If `hertz` is 0,
  configure for one-shot.

`int (*psm_get_clockirq)(int ipl)`::
  Return the vector of the clock interrupt.

`int (*psm_get_ipivect)(int ipl, int type)`::
   Allocate a vector for inter-processor interrupts at priority `ipl`.

`void (*psm_send_ipi)(processorid_t cpun, int ipl)`::
   Send an IPI of priority `ipl` to `cpun`.

`int (*psm_translate_irq)(dev_info_t *dip, int irqno)`::
   Translate `irqno` into a vector.  If PCI actually do translation, if not,
   set IRQ to ISA mode.  Returns `irqno` untranslated on failure.  NOTE: there
   is also an irq tranlation implementation in the interrupt operations.

`int (*psm_intr_ops)(dev_info_t *dip, ddi_intr_handle_impl_t *handle, psm_intr_op_t op, int *result)`::
   This is spiritually very similar to the DDI2 interrupt entry point,
   although with <<psm-operations, different operations>> (of different granularity).
   `dip` is the child device whos interrupts we are operating
   on, `handle` is the interrupt handle, the operation is dispatched on `op`,
   and `*result` is available to return further result information.

`int (*psm_get_pir_ipivect)(void)`::
   Return the vector used for the _Posted Interrupt Request_ (PIR) IPI, used
   for virtualization.

`void (*psm_send_pir_ipi)(processorid_t cpu)`::
   Send a PIR IPI to core `cpu`

`void (*psm_cmci_setup)(processorid_t cpu, boolean_t enable)`::
  Enable the _Corrected Machine Check Interrupt_ (CMCI) on `cpu` if `enable` is
  true, disable it otherwise.

[#psm-operations]
==== PSM Interrupt Operations (`psm_intr_op_t`)

[#psm-intr-op-alloc-vectors]
`PSM_INTR_OP_ALLOC_VECTORS`::
   Allocate interrupt vectors.  Return the number actually allocated in
   `*result`.  `mach_intr_ops` does nothing but succeeds.  apic/apix actually
   allocate vectors for `hdlp`.

[#psm-intr-op-free-vectors]
`PSM_INTR_OP_FREE_VECTORS`::
   Free interrupt vectors.  `mach_intr_ops` does nothing, apic/x actually frees
   the vectors (but apic does nothing for fixed interrupts, in lower code).

[#psm-intr-op-navail-vectors]
`PSM_INTR_OP_NAVAIL_VECTORS`::
   Return the number of available vectors in *result.  1 for fixed, 0
   otherwise in `mach_intr_ops`, apic/x returns the number of vectors availble
   at the `ih_pri` priority.

[#psm-intr-op-xlate-vector]
`PSM_INTR_OP_XLATE_VECTOR`::
  Translate the vector in `hdlp` into the global
  vector for PSM, and return it in *result.  Calls into `.psm_translate_irq()`
  and the op vector interface for fixed interrupts.  These both use an
  `intrspec` among the `ihdl_private` data.

[#psm-intr-op-get-pending]
`PSM_INTR_OP_GET_PENDING`::
  Get pending information.  Fail in `mach_intr_ops`,
  lookup up from the hardware on apic/x.

[#psm-intr-op-clear-mask]
`PSM_INTR_OP_CLEAR_MASK`::
  Clear the interrupt mask.  Fail in `mac_intr_ops`, work for fixed interrupts
  in apic/x, but not msi/x

[#psm-intr-op-set-mask]
`PSM_INTR_OP_SET_MASK`::
  Set the interrupt mask.  Fail in `mac_intr_ops`, work for fixed interrupts
  in apic/x, but not msi/x

[#psm-intr-op-get-cap]
`PSM_INTR_OP_GET_CAP`::
  Return capabilities of `dip` in `*result`.  0 from `mach_intr_ops`,
  `PENDING` from apic/x (and `MASKABLE` in addition, for fixed interrupts).

[#psm-intr-op-set-cap]
`PSM_INTR_OP_SET_CAP`::
  Set the capabilities of `dip`.  Fail in `mach_intr_ops`, and apic, and apix.

[#psm-intr-op-set-pri]
`PSM_INTR_OP_SET_PRI`::
  Set the priority of the interrupt.  Succeeds doing nothing with fixed
  interrupts, apic tears down and allocates new handles at the new priority.
  apix doesn't seem to do anything.

[#psm-intr-op-get-shared]
`PSM_INTR_OP_GET_SHARED`::
  Return non-0 in `*return` if the `ih_vector` is
  shared with another interrupt.  Only applicable to fixed interrupts.  The
  sharing count is tracked by the PSM implementations in their private
  metadata.  Fails in `mach_intr_ops`.

[#psm-intr-op-check-msi]
`PSM_INTR_OP_CHECK_MSI`::
  Return in `*result` whether `dip` supports MSI/X.  `*result` is a bitmask of
  <<interrupt-types, interrupt types>>

[#psm-intr-op-set-cpu]
`PSM_INTR_OP_SET_CPU`::
  Set the cpu to which the vector in `hdlp` should be

  `ih_private`.  Fails in `mach_intr_ops`.

[#psm-intr-op-get-intr]
`PSM_INTR_OP_GET_INTR`::
  Get information about the interrupt vector in `hdlp`.  `hdlp` is specific to
  this command and carries an <<apic-get-intr, `apic_get_intr_t *`>> as its `ih_private`, into

[#psm-intr-op-grp-set-cpu]
`PSM_INTR_OP_GRP_SET_CPU`::

  in `mach_intr_ops`

[#psm-intr-op-apic-type]
`PSM_INTR_OP_APIC_TYPE`::
  Returns information about the APIC.  `hdlp` is specific to this command and
  carries an <<apic-get-type, `apic_get_type_t *`>> as its `ih_private`, into which this command
  returns information about the APIC.  The apic version is surprisingly returned in the hdlp `ih_ver`.

==== Relationship Between DDI1 and DDI2 and PSM

`DDI_INTROP_GETCAP`::
  Entirely implemented by <<psm-intr-op-get-cap, `PSM_INTR_OP_GET_CAP`>> in the
  root nexus and ISA nexus.  PCI asks the PCI hardware what it supports, and
  then filters that based on the what the PSM operation returns.

`DDI_INTROP_SETCAP`::
  Entirely implemented by <<psm-intr-op-set-cap, `PSM_INTR_OP_SET_CAP`>> in the
  root nexus, PCI, and ISA nexuses.

`DDI_INTROP_ALLOC`::
  - The root nexus only deals in fixed interrupts.  The implementation uses
   <<psm-intr-op-alloc-vectors, `PSM_INTR_OP_ALLOC_VECTORS`>> if the apix PSM
   is in use.  The `intrspec` is updated in `ip_ispecp`.  In the non-apix
   case, `ih_pri` is initalized _from_ the `intrspec`.
  - The ISA nexus acts in the same manner as the root nexus
  - The PCI implementation does PCI-specific work then uses
   <<psm-intr-op-alloc-vectors, `PSM_INTR_OP_ALLOC_VECTORS`>>.  in the case of
   MSI/X `intrspec` is updated.  the `intrspec_pri` is updated _from_ the
   `ih_pri`. In the fixed case the `intrspec` is not updated.

`DDI_INTROP_FREE`::
  - The root nexus only deals in fixed interrupts.  In the apix case
    <<psm-intr-op-free-vectors, `PSM_INTR_OP_FREE_VECTORS`>> is used to free
    the vector.  Otherwise nothing happens except a distateful aside into
    PCMCIA.
  - ISA does the same as the root nexus, but without the PCMCIA aside.
  - PCI does PCI-specific work then uses <<psm-intr-op-free-vectors,
    `PSM_INTR_OP_FREE_VECTORS`.>>

`DDI_INTROP_GETPRI`::
  - The root nexus handles MSI/X as well as fixed.  The `intrspec` is the
    source of the priority which is returned.
  - The ISA nexus works in the same way as the root nexus.
  - The PCI code gets (or builds) an `intrspec` in a PCI-specific way, and
    returns the `intrspec_pri`.

`DDI_INTROP_SETPRI`::
  - The root nexus handles MSI/X as well as fixed.  It validates the priority,
    and calls <<psm-intr-op-set-pri, `PSM_INTR_OP_SET_PRI`>>.  `intrspec_pri`
    is updated.
  - The ISA nexus works in the same way as the root nexus.
  - The PCI nexus works in the same way as the root nexus.

`DDI_INTROP_ADDISR`::
  - The root nexus handles MSI/X as well as fixed.  It updates `intrspec_func`
    _from_ the `ih_cb_func`.
  - The ISA nexus works in the same way as the root nexus.
  - The PCI nexus works in the same way as the root nexus, but additionally
    creates the kstats in `ip_ksp`.

`DDI_INTROP_REMISR`::
  - The root nexus handles MSI/X as well as fixed.  It sets `intrspec_func` to
    `NULL`.
  - The ISA code works in the same way as the root nexus, but fails for
    non-fixed interrupts.
  - The PCI nexus works in the same way as the root nexus, but also delete's
    the `ip_ksp` kstates.

`DDI_INTROP_ENABLE`::
  - The root nexus translates the vector via <<psm-intr-op-xlate-vector,
    `PSM_INTR_OP_XLATE_VECTOR`>>, and stores the result in `ih_vector`, then
    adds the interrupt using the `intrspec_pri`, but the `ih_cb_func` and
    parameters.
  - The ISA nexus works like the root nexus, but with a hack for the Xen
    console.
  - The PCI nexus, for MSI, sets `intrspec_vec` _from_ `ih_inum` and
    `intrspec_pri` _from_ `ih_pri`. <<psm-intr-op-xlate-vector,
    `PSM_INTR_OP_XLATE_VECTOR`>> translates the vector and `ih_vector` is
    updated.  The interrupt is added using `ih_pri`, `ih_vector`, and
    `ih_cb_func` and its parameters.

`DDI_INTROP_DISABLE`::
  - The root nexus translates the vector with <<psm-intr-op-xlate-vector,
    `PSM_INTR_OP_XLATE_VECTOR`>>, and updates `ih_vector`, then removes the
    interrupt using `intrspec_pri` but `ib_cb_func` and `ih_vector`.
  - The ISA nexus works in the same way as the root nexus.
  - The PCI code, for MSI, sets `intrspec_vec` _from_ `ih_inum` and
    `intrspec_pri` _from_ `ih_pri`, translates the vector with
    <<psm-intr-op-xlate-vector, `PSM_INTR_OP_XLATE_VECTOR`>> but **does not**
    update `ih_vector`, then removes the interrupt using `ih_pri` and
    `ih_cb_func`.

`DDI_INTROP_SETMASK`::
  - The root nexus is implemented entirely via <<psm-intr-op-set-mask, `PSM_INTR_OP_SET_MASK`>>
  - The ISA nexus works the same way as the root nexus
  - The PCI code masks the interrupt in PCI hardware, and in the MSI/X case is
    finished.  In the fixed case it checks <<psm-intr-op-get-shared,
    `PSM_INTR_OP_GET_SHARED`>> and fails if the interrupt is shared, then uses
    <<psm-intr-op-set-mask, `PSM_INTR_OP_SET_MASK`>>.

`DDI_INTROP_CLRMASK`::
  - The root nexus is implemented entirely by <<psm-intr-op-clear-mask, `PSM_INTR_OP_CLEAR_MASK`>>
  - The ISA nexus works the same way as the root nexus
  - The PCI code masks the interrupt in PCI hardware, and in the MSI/X case is
    finished.  In the fixed case it checks <<psm-intr-op-get-shared, `PSM_INTR_OP_GET_SHARED`>> and fails
    if the interrupt is shared, then uses <<psm-intr-op-clear-mask, `PSM_INTR_OP_CLEAR_MASK`>>.  This is
    implemented in the same code paths as <<ddi-introp-setmask, `DDI_INTROP_SETMASK`>>.

`DDI_INTROP_GETPENDING`::
  - The root nexus is implemented entirely by <<psm-intr-op-get-pending, `PSM_INTR_OP_GET_PENDING`>>
  - The ISA nexus works the same way as the root nexus
  - The PCI code checks the PCI hardware for a pending bit and if that fails
    tries <<psm-intr-op-get-pending, `PSM_INTR_OP_GET_PENDING`>>.

`DDI_INTROP_NAVAIL`::
  - The root nexus returns the number of fixed interrupts on the device, which
    a hack for PCMCIA.  The implementation is the same as that for
    <<ddi-introp-nintrs, `DDI_INTROP_NINTRS`>>.
  - The ISA nexus (which is implicated in the PCMCIA hack in the root nexus)
    returns the number of fixed interrupts on the device.  The implementation
    is the same as that for <<ddi-introp-nintrs, `DDI_INTROP_NINTRS`>>.
  - The PCI code returns the number of fixed interrupts on the device, for
    fixed interrupts or the number of MSI/X the device could possibly support
    (regardless of resource management).  The implementation is the same as `DDI_INTROP_NINTRS`.

`DDI_INTROP_NINTRS`::
  See `DDI_INTROP_NAVAIL`, which uses the same implementation on all 3 nexuses

`DDI_INTROP_SUPPORTED_TYPES`::
  - The root nexus supports fixed interrupts only
  - The ISA nexus supports fixed interrupts only
  - The PCI code supports fixed interrupts, checks the PCI hardware for
    interrupt capabilities, and the system with <<psm-intr-op-check-msi,
    `PSM_INTR_OP_CHECK_MSI`>>, and depending on these results adds MSI and
    MSIX support

`DDI_INTROP_DUPVEC`::  Not supported by any Intel nexus

`DDI_INTROP_BLOCKENABLE`::
  - Not supported by the root nexus
  - Not supported by the ISA nexus
  - The PCI code enables all interrupts in the block one-by-one (and should
    any fail, disables them all again).  This is done in the same manner as
    individual <<ddi-introp-enable, `DDI_INTROP_ENABLE`>>, per-handle.

`DDI_INTROP_BLOCKDISABLE`::
  - Not supported by the root nexus
  - Not supported by the ISA nexus
  - The PCI code disables all interrupts in the block one-by-one.  This is
    done in the same manner as individual <<ddi-introp-disable, `DDI_INTROP_DISABLE`>>, per-handle.

`DDI_INTROP_GETPOOL`::
  - Not supported by the root nexus
  - Not supported by the ISA nexus
  - The PCI code returns the global apix pool when the apix PSM is in use.

`DDI_INTROP_GETTARGET`::
  - Not supported by the root nexus
  - Not support by the ISA nexus
  - The PCI code uses <<psm-intr-op-get-intr, `PSM_INTR_OP_GET_INTR`>>

=== SPARC

Interrupt operations follow the interrupt hierarchy expressed in the device
tree, described by <<1275-ofw, IEEE 1275 OpenFirmware>>, its <<1275-busses,
bus-specific bindings>>, and the <<1275-imap, "imap" interrupt mapping
extension>>.

Operations may be passed up the hierarchy, or implemented in each nexus to
program the hardware (the interrupt scheme on SPARC is simple, and this is
done directly, rather than via a PSM-like interface).

There are 3 distinct mechanisms for expressing the interrupt hierarchy of
fixed interrupts.  MSI/X interrupts are fully described by <<1275-msi, properties on the
host bridge>> and directly following the device tree is sufficient.

==== Directly following the parent/child relationship of the device tree

The earliest method, the interrupt hierarchy and the device tree match.  A
devices interrupt ancestry and its device tree (physical) ancestry are the
same.

image:dev-tree-parent.svg[]

NOTE: This applies to fixed interrupts absent other schemes, and is the only
method for MSI/X

==== Explicitly specified interrupt parent

Device hierarchy and interrupt hierarchy are orthogonal, nodes contain an
explicit reference to their interrupt domain, either via an
**interrupt-parent** property.

image:dev-tree-intr-parent.svg[]

NOTE: This applies to fixed interrupts only

NOTE: Support for this exists in the SPARC code, but it is not obvious that any
shipping platform ever made use of it.

==== General Interrupt Mapping

Device hierarchy and interrupt hierarchy are orthogonal, further the several
interrupts of a given device may be fielded by distinct interrupt controllers,
the mapping between child and parent vector and unit number may be expressed.

It is not clear whether the expression of unit number here is relevant for
anything other than processing multiple levels of interrupt mapping (where the
result of one is the input to the next).

This is done via the <<1275-imap, **"interrupt-map"**>>
property which is better explained by the standard document than by us.

NOTE: Support for this with fixed interrupts exists in the SPARC code and
shipping platforms have made use of it, however the implementation maps
directly to the root-most interrupt controller without making any stops on the
way

NOTE: Support for this with fixed interrupts in the SPARC code is broken
should any device have `#interrupt-cells` greater than 1.

==== Implementation

<<interrupt-operations, Interrupt operations>> follow two distinct paths through the
hierarchy.

1. MSI interrupts always follow the parent/child relationships of the device tree
  hierarchy itself.

2. The **DDI_INTROP_ADDISR**, **DDI_INTROP_REMISR**, **DDI_INTROP_ENABLE**,
  **DDI_INTROP_DISABLE**, **DDI_INTROP_BLOCKENABLE**,
  **DDI_INTROP_BLOCKDISABLE** operations take part in the full range of
  interrupt mapping described above, and are mapped through the interrupt
  hierarchy, rather than the device hierarchy.

3. All other operations on fixed interrupts follow the device tree hierarchy

In a survey of the current implementation busses handle #1 and #3 themselves,
without any actual movement through the hierarchy.  #2 is mapped directly onto
the root-most interrupt parent and handled there.

  - PCI acts in the same way as the root nexus
  - PCIe does not implement

=== AArch64

WARNING: The implementation described here is not the current implementation,
and exists only prototypically.

AArch64 systems are broken into two major categories based on their firmware
device tree implementation.

SBSA::
  <<arm-sbsa, The ARM Server Base System Architecture>> which is <<uefi-acpi,
  ACPI>> based.  An illumos device tree is built from information provided by
  the platform ACPI implementation, UEFI is mandatory.

Flat Device Tree (FDT)::
  The platform provides us with a <<devicetree-org, devicetree>> blob, which is superficially
  similar to and derived from an <<1275-ofw, IEEE 1275 OpenFirmware>> device
  tree, and the illumos device tree directly reflects this.  This may be
  provided by a boot-loader or statically in ROM.  The <<arm-ebbr,  ARM
  Embedded Base Boot Requirements>> describe platforms with UEFI but with FDT
  rather than ACPI.

Interrupt operations follow the interrupt hierarchy as described to us by the
firmware.  We assume that aside from the mechanism of discovering this
hierarchy, our journey through it will be equivalent for both implementations.

For the FDT cases the device tree reflects an exact interrupt hierarchy of
arbitrary complexity, which we have to understand how to follow.  For the ACPI
cases the device tree reflects a simpler scheme because of the limits from the
<<uefi-acpi, ACPI>> and <<arm-sbsa, SBSA>> specifications, but the hierarchy
must be added to the tree ourselves.  The simplicity then works out in our
favour (we don't, for instance, have to craft arbitrarily complicated
**"interrupt-map"** to describe the relationships, because such relationships
aren't possible).

==== SBSA

The interrupt hierarchy is described by <<uefi-acpi, ACPI>>.

In the DSDT nodes there may be at least:
- `_PRT` describing PCI interrupt routing
- `_CRS` describing the "Current Resource Settings"
- `_PRS` describing the "Possible Resource Settings"

There are cases where hardware is also described in other tables, and via
other methods.

The information necessary here will be added into the device tree when it is
built, assigning **"interrupts"**, **"interrupt-parent"**, as necessary to
describe the hardware and hierarchy.  This is basically what happens on Intel
(except as mentioned, Intel has no need for interrupt parent information).

ACPI systems support one root interrupt controller (they can't describe more).

==== FDT

The device tree contains the interrupt hierarchy, expressed via a superset of
the mechanisms used on SPARC.

There is an <<devicetree-interrupts-extended, additional mechanism>> for fixed
interrupts, and an <<devicetree-msi, entirely different>> method of
handling MSI.

In this case we definitely see cascaded fixed interrupt controllers below the
root controller.  In cases like the serial on RaspberryPi,4 or the GPIO on
many bits hardware, we have a single interrupt shared between multiple
hardware functions behind a piece of hardware we can use to check for whom the
interrupt was intended, or use to mask/route/control the interrupt.

It is possible -- in theory, the implementation would be a lot -- to demux
these and give each device its own vector, rather than sharing the vector as
with otherwise shared (but not truly multiplexed) fixed interrupts.  Without
strong motivation (one such motivation would be if in practice we see devices
which storm interrupts on shared vectors, and affect performance).

[#devicetree-interrupts-extended]
===== "interrupts-extended"

Rather than an **"interrupts"** property, a list of interrupt vectors, an
**"interrupts-extended"** property is used which is a list of pairs `<vector,
controller>` specifying the vector and the controller on which it is
relevant.

This allows describing a device which spreads its interrupts to separate
controllers, but without requiring the full mapping of **"interrupt-map"**.

NOTE: illumos does not currently support this mechanism, as we haven't seen it
in use.

[#devicetree-msi]
===== Devicetree MSI

The devicetree.org specification has a mechanism for expressing MSI that is
entirely distinct from that adopted by OpenFirmware on SPARC.

The **"msi-parent"** property is a list of `<RID, controller>` pairs, where
the RID may be absent if **"#msi-cells"** is 0.  This list is not ordered, and
software may use any combination in any order.

For MSI on PCI there is an **"msi-map"** property, which maps ranges of RID
to MSI specifiers on specific controllers.

NOTE: illumos does not currently support this mechanism, as MSI support on
AArch64 does not yet exist

==== Message Signalled Interrupts

WARNING: the prototype does not implement MSI/X at all, this is all thoroughly
pre-implementation thinking

There are several ways MSI/X are implement on AArch64

1. A GIC v2m device alongside GIC version 2, which maps MSI onto a range of
  vectors shared with fixed interrupts.  The GIC controls affinity.

2. A GIC v3 device directly receives messages and maps MSI onto a range of
  vectors shared with fixed interrupts. (Message Based SPIs).  For FDT the
  mapping is expressed in the devicetree or device binding, ACPI cannot
  express this.

3. ... the above, but level-triggered.  illumos has no concept of a
  level-triggered MSI, and one would probably need to be added, if we were to
  implement this.

4. A GIC v3 redistributor device directly receives messages and raises
  _locality-specific peripheral interrupts_ (LPIs).  This is basically #2 but
  without mapping onto vectors shared with fixed interrupts, the vector is now
  in a specific (very broad) range..  affinity is implicit in the choice of
  redistributor device.  This is mutually exclusive with #5

5. _Interrupt Translation Service_ (ITS) devices receive messages which raises
  LPIs like #4.  Affinity is handled by the ITS.

6. Devices like RaspberryPi,4 which has a GIC version 2 with no v2m, and
  handles MSI in the PCIe host (which is basically how SPARC hardware seemed
  to work).

This appears to fit with the scheme described, whereby we attach drivers that
field these interrupts as we would any other.  Some drivers need to handle
both fixed and MSI/X, some only one or the other.

Of the methods above, it seems like we have no reason to implement #3.
Whether to implement #4 depends on how commonly used it is compared to #5 (and
vice-versa).

#6 is either very simple and transparent to us, or requires that the
downstream nexus be an interrupt controller for our purposes.

==== Implementation

[#no-intrspec]
===== `struct intrspec`-free operation

Given `struct intrspec` is insufficient to describe interrupts on the GIC, it
is to our advantage of nothing in the AArch64 support treated an intrspec as
canonical.  Common nexuses that uses them in there implementation is fine
because we can guarantee that they represent an interrupt domain with an
interrupt representation that the intrspec is sufficient for.

The problem area is interrupts that directly target the GIC (those passing
through the root nexus and the interrupt controller drivers themselves), or
any AArch64-specific devices with bindings that `struct intrspec` cannot
represent.

SPARC is almost entirely free of `struct intrspec`, which suggests this is
not only practical but desirable -- it must have been removed from the SPARC
code already.

===== Early use

Interrupt controllers in the path between the system clock and the CPU must
provide a limited interface to allow this clock interrupt to be established.

This is to avoid an unfortunate chicken-and-egg situation where we need the
clock interrupt to build the device tree, and the device tree to establish the
clock interrupt via the DDI interfaces.  The intel platform does this via
calling into the PSM, which the current AArch64 scheme does not have (or
probably need).

===== Structure

====== Interrupt Establishing Operations

As on SPARC, we expect at least the relevant subset of interrupt operations
(**DDI_INTROP_ADDISR**, **DDI_INTROP_REMISR**, **DDI_INTROP_ENABLE**,
**DDI_INTROP_DISABLE**, **DDI_INTROP_BLOCKENABLE**,
**DDI_INTROP_BLOCKDISABLE**) to be mapped to a driver attached to hardware
functioning as an interrupt controller.  On SPARC these would be host bridge
drivers, which would then establish their interrupts directly.  The actual
root-most interrupt hardware is part of the basic platform.

On AArch64 we have several possible root-most interrupt controllers, 3
possible versions of the ARM Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC), and several
methods of transmitting MSI/X to the root controller, and cannot practically
follow this scheme as-is, since the actual establishment of the interrupt in
hardware is interrupt-controller dependent.

The Intel platform uses the PSM to abstract over this, in a manner not
entirely dissimilar from the way the DDI2 implementation abstracts over
interrupt operations.  See <<psm-ddi2-comparison, the comparison>> for how
they line up.

On AArch64 the interrupt controllers available to us are present in the device
tree directly, and the mapping between hardware and interrupt controllers is
clearly expressed there (or in the case of ACPI, can be expressed there in a
well known way) we choose to attach distinct drivers to these controllers, and
allow those drivers to handle the low-level establishment of interrupts.  In
spirit, if not entirely in fact, the PSM operation called "on" the interrupt
controller is replaced with the matching DDI2 operation mapped up the
interrupt hieararchy.

This means that the system has full device drivers, rather than misc modules
attaching to any GIC v2 or GIC v3 interrupt controllers, and in the future,
drivers for the GIC v2m frame, and GIC ITS MSI to GIC translation hardware.

All busses are expected to call `i_ddi_intr_ops()` to pass the request to
higher levels of the interrupt hierarchy, and to the correct instance of the
drivers attached to the interrupt controllers.

NOTE: While it may seem surprising, it is a valid topology for the rootnex to
have an **"interrupt-parent"** that actually fields the interrupts, rather than each
bus pointing to the interrupt controller.  That is, the root nexus is the root
of the device tree _but not necessarily the interrupt hieararchy_.  This is
how QEMU,virt works and is also the most convenient way to establish a default
**"interrupt-parent"** for ACPI systems.

====== Other Interrupt Operations

Other operations may be handled directly by nexus drivers, or passed up the
device tree hierarchy to refine their results.

WARNING: This is a weak point in the scheme described here.

Why do these operations follow a different hierarchy, and get direct answers
from busses, except for this was how things work on SPARC? (where the
hierarchies are almost always, we think, isomorphic).

Why do busses answer on their own behalf, does the root system not have any
say in resource availability, etc?

The answer in the current prototype is that this is how SPARC worked, and that
is directly analogous to how interrupts are structured for us too.

It would be nice if:

. All operations that can follow the interrupt hierarchy, did.  Even if this
  meant temporary handles have to be more completely allocated.
. It were clear and documented which operations follow which hieararchy, and
  whom we expect to be ultimately responsible.

===== Rationale

The approach used in our Intel codebase is usually the more attractive,
because that code base is actively maintained.  In this case though the nature
of interrupts on the platform, such as the potential for arbitrary cascading
of interrupt controllers make the approach of having each nexus directly
establish interrupts via a PSM seem unworkable.  We may have to program
multiple controllers on the way through the hierarchy, at which we would at
best be emulating the journey through the interrupt hierarchy of the device
tree.  Further, the PSM operations interface and the DDI2 interface are
<<psm-ddi2-comparison, so similar>>, it's not obvious what benefit there would be

The approach used on SPARC seems to fit our needs, and in fact the prototype
is very SPARC-y with the exception that interrupt establishing operations pass
each node up the tree, rather than directly going to the uppermost.  This
seems to be because the SPARC platform has a simple interrupt programming
interface, here `add_ivintr()` registers a handler in an interrupt vector used
for vectored interrupts, and mondo interrupts are effectively message based,
queued in hardware and de-queued in software.

The SPARC approach though is also somewhat dissatisfying.  Why must we take
two distinct paths through the device tree depending on the interrupt
operation?  With the exception of <<ddi-introp-supported-types,
`DDI_INTROP_SUPPORTED_TYPES`>> which cannot reach an interrupt controller
(would it go to the fixed or MSI controller?).

It would be nice to have a simpler scheme where the path through the tree was
not split like this, where each operation is expected to call its parent via
`i_ddi_intr_ops()` either to provide the information, or to provide further
filtering to the value in `*result`.

The addition of MSI support on ARM will present a departure from the SPARC
scheme. On SPARC it is assumed that a direct ancestor of our device will be a
host bridge device which will handle translating MSIs to Mondos (or whatever
ends up happening), the same assumption as used to exist for fixed
interrupts, too.  Whereas on ARM we have potentially several such devices
appearing discretely and handling MSI/X for different subsets of devices in
the system, to which they may (and usually do) have no familial relation in
the device tree.

===== Problems

A major outstanding wart in the prototype is that on real platforms, we can
take several paths through the interrupt tree depending on the device and its
position in the device tree.  This means that there is no single global place
to provide book-keeping at the DDI level.  Much of this bookkeeping is at
present maintaining the `struct intrspec` compatibility pieces in the parent
private data, and would go away if and when that does, but I am not convinced
it is all the global bookkeeping we would ever want.  Counter to my instincts
is the fact that interrupt support on SPARC makes this work without shared
bookkeeping.

Another wart is that a full conversion to this scheme is an unfortunate amount
of work to the extent that a lot of our machine dependent drivers are more
Intel-derived than SPARC derived, so their interrupt operations must be
refactored, perhaps substantially, and retested.

This sounds bad, but <<psm-ddi2-comparison, the comparison>> between
<<psm-operations, PSM operations>> and <<interrupt-operations, DDI2
operations>> shows a lot of overlap where calls to PSM operations would be
directly replaced with `i_ddi_intr_ops()` calls.  Other operations are either
unnecessary in this scheme (vector translation) or not currently implementable
on AArch64, but with the appearance we could implement these in the same manner.

====== Vastly increased interrupt vector space

The autovectoring interrupt support in illumos currently has a maximum of 256
vectors.  The vector space on AArch64 is vastly larger than this, although
sparse.

WARNING: The implementation of autovectoring is also inconsistent about what
happens to vectors > 256.  `add_avintr()` and `rem_avintr()` will take the
vector modulo `MAX_VECT` as the index into the table, `av_dispatch_autovect()`
will not do this, and assert the vector itself is lower than `MAX_VECT`.  All
other code on all other platforms will just overrun `autovect[MAX_VECT]`.

The apix PSM has a problem not unlike ours, and solves it using the `addintr`
and `remintr` function pointers, which if non-NULL entirely replace the
implementation of `add_avintr()` and `rem_avintr()`.  The metadata tracked in
the GIC implementations just keeps an AVL of active vectors, rather than a
huge sparse table.  This is problematic in interrupt context though.

==== Interrupt Handle Platform Data (`ihdl_plat_t`)

Platform-specific data associated with an <<interrupt-handle, interrupt
handle>>.  This is currently as it is on Intel but incompletely used, and with
some additional fields

`kstat_t *ip_ksp`::
  **kstat(3kstat)** statistics for this interrupt handle, used by the PCI
  nexuses.  Currently unused in the PCI prototype, but expected.

`uint64_t ip_ticks`::
  The number of ticks spent fielding this device's interrupts.

`uint32_t ihdl_gic_cfg`::
  Currently used to smuggle the "configuration" part
  of a 3-tuple interrupt from the GIC Devicetree binding.  WARNING: Being
  phased out in favour of `ip_unitintr`.

`uint32_t ihdl_gic_sense`::
  Currently used to smuggle the "sense" part of a 3-tuple interrupt from the
  GIC Devicetree binding.
  WARNING:  Being phased out in favour of `ip_unitintr`

`unit_intr_t *ip_unitintr`::
  A device-tree unit interrupt descriptor (the combination of unit address and
  interrupt descriptor).  Used by interrupt mapping internal to the AArch64
  DDI implementation.  This is actually specific to the FDT implementation,
  but should exist in a usable manner given a devicetree constructed from
  ACPI.  This is opaque (actually, impossible to correctly interpret) to
  anyone not the interrupt-controller currently processing `hdlp` and the DDI
  implementation.
